# Level-Up Plans for Ansible API

## Security & Secrets Management
- Integrate Vault Agent for automatic authentication and secret renewal.
- Add detailed audit logging for every playbook run.
- Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for API endpoints.

## API & UX Improvements
- Auto-generate and serve Swagger/OpenAPI docs.
- Build a simple web dashboard to view, filter, and manage jobs.
- Stream live playbook output using WebSockets or Server-Sent Events.

## Notifications & Integrations
- Add Slack/MS Teams/webhook notifications for job events.
- Implement email alerts for job completion or failure.configconfig
- Integrate with GitHub Checks to report playbook run status on PRs.

## Extensibility & Flexibility
- Create a plugin system for custom pre/post hooks.
- Add support for more VCS (GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.).
- Support dynamic inventory files or scripts.

## Observability & Reliability
- Expose Prometheus metrics for job counts, durations, and failures.
- Allow scaling out job processing across multiple nodes.
- Add configurable retry/backoff policies for failed jobs.

## Developer Experience
- Provide a CLI client for interacting with the API.
- Add integration tests for the API and job processing.
- Create a config validation endpoint for playbooks and inventory.

## Cool Factor
- Build a live terminal UI (TUI) for real-time job monitoring.
- Integrate AI assistant to suggest playbooks or auto-generate inventory.
- Generate QR codes for job status pages for quick mobile access.
